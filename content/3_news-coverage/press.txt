  excerpt: |
    **Albany, N.Y./Rochester, N.Y**. – Legislators behind a new proposal in Albany say their legislation would target tax breaks against New York’s wealthiest to help reduce the state’s deficit.
    
    The “Invest in Our New York Act” aims to address economic inequality in the state, including for families impacted by COVID-19.
    
    Supporters claim past state budgets have aimed at cutting crucial services as a means to help New York’s economy. This, they allege, has come at a cost for vulnerable New Yorkers.

  excerpt: |
    One day before the Legislature is supposed to start its new session, the big names on the state’s progressive left are announcing a coalition and campaign called Invest In Our New York, which promises that raising revenue from the richest individuals and corporations will be their top priority in 2021. They’re starting later today outside Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s New York City office and are planning a multi-punch rollout with events in Albany, Rochester and Long Island this week.
    
    **It’s a direct counter to the past and current budgeting practices of the governor, who has for months held off on addressing the fiscal strain he says the pandemic has caused and instead chosen to wait on the federal government for aid.**

  excerpt: |
    **ALBANY** — A new coalition of progressive legislators and grassroots organizations wants New York’s billionaires to pay their fair share.
    
    "By ending tax breaks for the rich, Gov., Cuomo and our leaders in Albany can prove their commitment to small businesses struggling to keep their doors open, students who deserve quality education, and everyday New Yorkers who suddenly find themselves unemployed, on food lines and unable to pay their rent," said Rebecca Bailin, who is managing the campaign.

    “Yes, we need federal government help. I will give you that. But even that alone won’t save this city’s new state,” said Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. “What [you] have to do as governor is use all of the tools that are available to you. You have not done that.”

  excerpt: |
    **ALBANY, N.Y. (WRGB)** — As New York faces an unprecedented budget deficit of $60 billion over 4 years, working New Yorkers refuse to balance the budget on the backs of Black, brown and low-income communities.
    
    …Organizers say Gov. Cuomo has responded to the state's economic crisis with austerity, cutting essential services and failing to provide relief to the millions of New Yorkers who are experiencing food insecurity and are at risk of eviction. Community organizations, labor, faith, and service providers across the state stand with elected representatives in calling for between $50 billion and $70 billion in new, equitable revenue for a just budget and recovery for all.

    Progressive groups unite to focus on
    taxing the wealthy

    https://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/291331/progressive-groups-unite-to-focus-on-taxing-the-wealthy/
  excerpt: |
    **ALBANY** – With New York anticipating a multi-billion-dollar deficit for years to come, progressive groups are uniting in their efforts to convince state legislators to approve tax increases on the wealthiest New Yorkers.
    
    During a typical legislative session, advocacy groups would flood the Capitol to lobby lawmakers on various causes, programs and issues, but the coronavirus pandemic has kept the Capitol closed to visitors since early in the public health crisis and it remains closed to the public. While some issues progressive groups focus on may dovetail into one another, usually their priorities differ when lobbying lawmakers. But with state budget officials estimating a $64 billion deficit over the next four years, advocacy groups have honed in on raising revenue by taxing those who can afford it as a common cause to achieve their collective priorities.
    
    The size of the budget deficit is up for debate, with policy analysts estimating a smaller gap when factoring in actual revenues and federal aid received.
    
    Dozens of grassroot organizations and legislators on Tuesday held a virtual press conference to draw attention and support for a package of bills that raise taxes on wealthy residents, including taxing Wall Street transactions, a capital gains tax and a tax on inherited wealth, among others, projected to raise over $50 billion, according to a report conducted by the Invest in Our New York Campaign.
