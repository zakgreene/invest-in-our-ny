If passed, the Invest In Our New York Act would represent the single largest measure taken to close New York\u2019s inequality gap in decades, marking a massive reversal from years of austerity budgets that have decimated public schools, affordable housing, healthcare, immigrant workers, and localities, while providing tax breaks to the wealthiest New Yorkers.<\/p><p>The Capital Gains Tax will counteract the enormous tax break that capital gains enjoy on the federal level \u2014 between 9% - 17% depending on the income tier \u2014 and will generate over $7 billion in new revenue. The federal government currently taxes income from \u201ccapital gains\u201d at a much lower rate than the \"ordinary income\" that most New Yorkers make at their jobs. This practice led to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/15\/opinion\/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Warren Buffet explaining that he pays less in taxes than his secretary<\/a>. The preference that the federal government gives capital gains amounts to a tax break that is only available to the extremely rich, as<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/blog\/tax-preference-for-capital-gains-doesnt-make-sense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"> nearly all of the capital gains that are accumulated every year go to the top 1%<\/a>. This legislation would thus largely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/11\/25\/opinion\/coronavirus-billionaires.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">raise revenue from the wealthy New Yorkers who continue to profit off the pandemic<\/a> as their neighbors lose income, health coverage, and access to essential social services.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cBillionaires and millionaires in our State have become wealthier during this pandemic while working-class New Yorkers are struggling to make ends meet,\" said <strong>State Senator Gustavo Rivera<\/strong>. \u201cCreating new revenue streams by increasing taxes on the most affluent among us will ensure our communities receive the relief they deserve for the sacrifices they have made during this difficult time. That\u2019s why I proudly sponsor this bill to tax capital gains, part of the Invest in Our New York Act. With this bill, New York will finally eliminate an unfair tax break that taxes investment income at a lower rate than income from wages. Taxing the wealthy is a moral imperative that will allow us to proactively invest in our communities.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple \u2014 there is no taxing the rich if we don\u2019t tax long-term investment and capital gains,\u201d said <strong>Assemblymember Ron Kim<\/strong>. \u201cClose to 90% of investment income comes from the top 10%, who have managed to avoid paying taxes on their gains or are taxed at a considerably lower rate than labor income. State and federal regulators have claimed that they could not track and properly analyze capital assets, but that is no longer the case. We have the tools and technologies to get this done.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cMillions of New Yorkers are struggling to put food on the table and make rent \u2014 and our state has a responsibility to raise the revenue needed to to lift up and support our communities. We can raise a crucial $7 billion of that revenue by simply ending the arcane practice of undertaxed capital gains,\u201d said <strong>Invest In Our New York Campaign Manager Rebecca Bailin.<\/strong> \u201cThe bill introduced by Senator Rivera and Assemblymember Kim will accomplish exactly that. By ending this regressive tax break for the rich, Governor Cuomo and our legislature can prove their commitment to the many, not the few.\u201d<\/p><p>##Bill Details<\/p>"},"id":"ccc4358b-8b8a-46d4-85ad-e6cd2a456d3e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"left":"State Senate, (link: https:\/\/www.nysenate.gov\/legislation\/bills\/2021\/s2522 text: S2522)\nSponsored by Senator Gustavo Rivera (SD-33)","right":"Assembly, (link: https:\/\/assembly.state.ny.us\/leg\/?bn=A03352&leg_video= text: A03352)\nSponsored by Assemblymember Ron Kim (AD-40)"},"id":"8e81a25e-b876-4c18-99ce-8ec8685a2b2a","isHidden":false,"type":"columns"},{"content":{"text":"<p>###About the Invest In Our New York Campaign: <\/p><p>The Invest in Our New York Campaign is a legislative effort to pass the Invest In Our New York Act: a package of six state bills that raises more than $50 billion to ensure we can take care of each other and rebuild our economy by ending tax breaks for the richest New Yorkers.
