Subhead: Sign up for upcoming phonebanking opportunities to help push NYS leaders to Tax the Rich & Invest In Our New York

----

Statement-pre: Over the past 10 budgets, the Governor has led the state into a massive deficit and a tiny rainy day fund. Governor Cuomo has failed to budget effectively. The Invest In Our New York Act is common sense legislation to end tax breaks on the very wealthy.

----

Statement:

- After the 2008 financial crisis, economists found that states that leaned on spending cuts delayed recovery by 4 years. Tax increases on the very wealthy, conversely, have a positive effect: they grow the GDP.

- Example of antiquated tax code: Right now in NY, individuals with incomes between $21,000 and $1,000,000 all pay roughly the same state tax rate of 6.5%.  

- 90% of New Yorkers support taxes on the wealthy rather than cuts to working people.
