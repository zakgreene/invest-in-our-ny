Heading: Tell Governor Cuomo, Invest in Our New York

----

Subhead: The Invest in Our New York Act raises $50 billion to rebuild our economyby ending tax breaks for the richest New Yorkers

----

Statement-pre: New York is facing an unprecedented economic crisis: while millions of New Yorkers can’t make rent or put food on the table, the wealthiest New Yorkers have grown $77 billion richer during the pandemic.

----

Statement:

Meanwhile, the wealthiest New Yorkers have grown $77 billion richer during the pandemic. We know our economy will only recover when working people have money in their wallets — and that means Governor Andrew Cuomo must end tax breaks for the wealthy and start investing in our New York.

We demand: $50 billion in new revenue by ending tax breaks for the wealthiest New Yorkers; Prevent cuts to public programs; Invest in high quality education, jobs, housing, healthcare and more, and ensure revenue benefits the most vulnerable communities, including low-income New Yorkers, communities of color, workers excluded from federal unemployment and essential workers.

We can take care of each other and rebuild our economy if we raise $50 billion to Invest in Our New York.
